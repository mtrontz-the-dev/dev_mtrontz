[Learn](https://handsondataviz.org/gh-pages-link-to-iframe.html)
### Highlights
> - For any GitHub repository you have published online, go to its Settings page and scroll down to copy its GitHub Pages web address, which will appear in this general format:
[https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY]

> - Convert it into an iframe by enclosing the link inside quotation marks as the source, and adding both start and end tags, in this general format:
[<iframe src="https://USERNAME.github.io/RESPOSITORY"></iframe>]

> - If desired, improve the iframe appearance on the secondary site by adding any of these optional attributes, such as width or height (measured in pixels by default, or percentages), or frameborder="0" or scrolling="no", in this general format:
[<iframe src= "https://USERNAME.github.io/RESPOSITORY" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>]

# How can I embed a YouTube video on GitHub wiki pages?
[Learn](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11804820/how-can-i-embed-a-youtube-video-on-github-wiki-pages)
### Summary
Markdown does not officially support video embeddings but you can embed raw HTML in it. I tested out with GitHub Pages and it works flawlessly.
> - Go to the Video page on YouTube and click on the Share Button
> - Choose Embed
> - Copy and Paste the HTML snippet in your markdown
<br>
The snippet looks like:

    <iframe width="560" height="315"src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MUQfKFzIOeU" 
    frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in- 
    picture"allowfullscreen></iframe>
