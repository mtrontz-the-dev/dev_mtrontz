### What is Cloud Foundry? <a id="section-heading-1"></a>

Cloud Foundry ensures that the build and deploy aspects of coding remain carefully coordinated with any attached services — resulting in quick, consistent and reliable iterating of applications.
{% endhint %}

As an industry-standard platform as a service \(PaaS\), Cloud Foundry ensures the fastest, easiest and most reliable deployment of cloud-native applications. IBM offers the Cloud Foundry PaaS in several hosting models, allowing you to customize your PaaS experience and balance a range of considerations, including price, deployment speed and security.

#### Extend apps with services

Runtimes link IBM Cloud® services to applications as endpoints, giving any instance of an application embedded knowledge of how to manage relevant calls and data. Runtimes manage all linked resources this way. This includes SDKs, APIs \(whether as cloud services or from a traditional enterprise as custom services\), and applications when used as resources by other applications.
