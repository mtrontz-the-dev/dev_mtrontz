# AWS Caching Overview

## Highlights:

### What is Caching? <a id="What_is_Caching.3F"></a>

In computing, a cache is a high-speed data storage layer which stores a subset of data, typically transient in nature, so that future requests for that data are served up faster than is possible by accessing the dataâ€™s primary storage location. Caching allows you to efficiently reuse previously retrieved or computed data.  


### How does Caching work? <a id="How_does_Caching_work.3F"></a>

The data in a cache is generally stored in fast access hardware such as RAM \(Random-access memory\) and may also be used in correlation with a software component. A cache's primary purpose is to increase data retrieval performance by reducing the need to access the underlying slower storage layer.

Trading off capacity for speed, a cache typically stores a subset of data transiently, in contrast to databases whose data is usually complete and durable.
